## Commands Explained

### `git clone`

The `git clone` command is used to create a local copy (a "clone") of a remote repository.

**Syntax:**

```bash
git clone <repository URL>
```

- `<repository URL>`: The URL of the remote repository you want to clone.

**Example:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codepanuvom/Codepanuvom.git
```

This command will download the repository located at `https://github.com/codepanuvom/Codepanuvom.git` and create a local copy in a directory named `Codepanuvom`.
